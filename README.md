## Education: 
I graduated in May 2020 from the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering.

## Location: 
I have lived in Titusville, FL and Mobile, AL, but am currently residing in Cincinnati, OH.

## Interests: 
Activities I spend my free time on are studying mechatronics, robotics, cloud infrastructure, self hosting, and drinking beer and whiskey.

## Language Bio: 
Before college, I'd never programmed a day in my life. Freshmen year, MEs are required to learn a data and math oriented programming language/ecosystem called Matlab. Matlab just never felt right to me even though I was forced to use it for 3 years and have used it in the field. But after really doing some research I came across Python. Python had enough overlap with Matlab in the data and math sectors due to it's mature ecosystem that I was able to find excuses in my coursework to swap it inplace over Matlab. Python was the entryway for me into the rest of programming and open source software as a whole. Soon after, I did discover Octave, and when forced to use the Matlab language for coursework, I'd opt to develop in Octave and just check my code once with Matlab before submitting (Octave is mainly compatible with Matlab syntax and where it varies it is well documented). While studying (really working) abroad in Japan, I had some more free time in the evenings and dove into learning Go. This took at lot less time than I expected to get the basics down. One of Go's best features really is simplicity and readability. Recently, I've been diving into Rust. I'm going through the [Rust Embedded Discovery Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/) on the STM32 as well as [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action).
